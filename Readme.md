1. Create an OpenSSL Configuration File (Optional but Recommended)
To ensure your certificate includes the proper Subject Alternative Name (SAN), create a file (e.g., ui.kinodev.localhost.cnf) with the following content:

ini
Copy
[req]
default_bits       = 2048
prompt             = no
default_md         = sha256
req_extensions     = req_ext
distinguished_name = dn

[dn]
C  = US
ST = YourState
L  = YourCity
O  = YourOrganization
CN = ui.kinodev.localhost

[req_ext]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = ui.kinodev.localhost
Customize the fields (like C, ST, L, and O) as needed.

127.0.0.1 api-gateway.kinodev.localhost
127.0.0.1 domain-service.kinodev.localhost
127.0.0.1 ui.kinodev.localhost
127.0.0.1 identity.kinodev.localhost
127.0.0.1 payment-service.kinodev.localhost
127.0.0.1 email-service.kinodev.localhost
127.0.0.1 functions.kinodev.localhost

etc

2. Generate the Certificate and Private Key

3. Configure Traefik to Use Your Certificate
Update your Traefik static configuration (for example, in your traefik.yml or traefik.toml) to reference your newly generated certificate. For a YAML configuration, it might look like this:

yaml
Copy
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":80"
  websecure:
    address: ":443"
    tls:
      certificates:
        - certFile: "/certs/ui.kinodev.localhost.crt"
          keyFile: "/certs/ui.kinodev.localhost.key"
