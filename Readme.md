1. Create an OpenSSL Configuration File (Optional but Recommended)
To ensure your certificate includes the proper Subject Alternative Name (SAN), create a file (e.g., ui.kinodev.localhost.cnf) with the following content:

ini
Copy
[req]
default_bits       = 2048
prompt             = no
default_md         = sha256
req_extensions     = req_ext
distinguished_name = dn

[dn]
C  = US
ST = YourState
L  = YourCity
O  = YourOrganization
CN = ui.kinodev.localhost

[req_ext]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = ui.kinodev.localhost
Customize the fields (like C, ST, L, and O) as needed.

2. Generate the Certificate and Private Key
Run the following OpenSSL command in your terminal to create a self-signed certificate valid for 365 days:

bash
Copy
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout ui.kinodev.localhost.key \
  -out ui.kinodev.localhost.crt \
  -config ui.kinodev.localhost.cnf \
  -extensions req_ext
This command produces:

ui.kinodev.localhost.key: Your private key.
ui.kinodev.localhost.crt: Your self-signed certificate.
3. Configure Traefik to Use Your Certificate
Update your Traefik static configuration (for example, in your traefik.yml or traefik.toml) to reference your newly generated certificate. For a YAML configuration, it might look like this:

yaml
Copy
entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":80"
  websecure:
    address: ":443"
    tls:
      certificates:
        - certFile: "/certs/ui.kinodev.localhost.crt"
          keyFile: "/certs/ui.kinodev.localhost.key"



openssl.exe req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout kinodev.key -out kinodev.crt -config kinodev.cnf -extensions req_ext
